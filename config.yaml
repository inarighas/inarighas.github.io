      In the past, I studied signal processing, mathematical modeling and statistics.
      I was intersted (and still have interest) in Bayesian Modeling to study human cognition and particularly language skills.
      Right now, I am working as a data scientist in industry where I mainly build and train models for voice processing and other language-related technologies.
      Check my blogposts, I post in there, from time to time, some news & some useful stuff.

      I'm **Ali Saghiran**, I have studied signal processing at Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble INP) and did my PhD
       in Computational modeling and cognitive science at Grenoble Alpes University.
      During my PhD, I was interested in studying speech production and perception using bayesian/probabilistic modeling.      
      I had work experience in both academia, as research assistant/engineer, and in industry as a software engineer.
